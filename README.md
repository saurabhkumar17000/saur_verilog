**Project:Traffic Signal Controller** using FSM
The traffic signal for the main highway gets highest priorty because cars are continuosly present on the main highway.(default signal green)
Their is a sensor on country road where hardly any traffic comes,whenever that road have any car to cross then that sensor will give 1.
For that particular time we need to green this country road signal.
Also we need to add delay in transitions from yellow to red light and red to green light.
